1. Are you working alone or with someone else?
I'm working with Tanav Dandekar on the final project. I plan to
dedicate as much time as needed to this project. I'll start work
on it early and will continue to, with Tanav, refine our project.
At the beginning, we'll outline everything we want to do and go over it like that.
2. We're going to use the Bank Marketing dataset

3. Null: For our dataset which shows if a client subscribes to a term deposit for a Portugese banking institution. We can show that a person's previous history (outcome of previous campaign, number of contacts before, etc.) with this banking institution will not impact whether or not they'll subscribe for a term deposit.

Alternative: For our dataset which shows if a client subscribes to a term deposit for a Portugese banking insitution. We can show that a person's previous history with this banking institution will impact whether or not they'll subscribe for a term deposit.

4. We plan to perform logistic regression because we have a binary column which we are using for our prediction. This column shows whether or not they subscribed for a term deposit. We can also use KNN with the dataset.
