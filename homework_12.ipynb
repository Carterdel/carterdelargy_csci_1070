This is because it gives full scores to some sentences like the title, \"Book I\". Other than that, it works though. The highest scoring ones in negative are also short, being one or two words, like \"No!\" or \"Oh hell!\". The positive scores have a similar issue. It also uses some twice, like \"O Friends\" and \"O friends\", with them both getting full 1.0 scores. It also has \"O Heaven\" twice with no apparent difference between them. "
